# Using the Parser Block

To work with the parser block, follow these two steps:

1. Add the IDs of the YouTube channels that you want to research to the `channel_id.txt` file.
2. Run `parser.py`.

After the parser finishes its work, a directory with the results of parsing and a database file will be created
in the current directory. If you need to change the address of the `channel_id.txt` file, the directory with the 
results, or the database file, you can modify the `SETTINGS` section in the `parser.py` file.
