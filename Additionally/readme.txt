To work with the paraser block, you need only two actions:
1) Add the IDs of the researched YouTube channels to the channel_id.txt;
2) run parser.py.

At the end of the work, a directory with the result of parsing and a database file will be created in the current directory.
If necessary, the address of the channel_id.txt file, the directory with the results and the database file can be changed in the parser.py in SETTINGS.
